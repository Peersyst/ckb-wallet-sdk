# Introduction

## What will we see?

In this section we will see how to implement a service for an application that uses our sdk to perform basic wallet functionalities. It will be able to see our balance, addresses, tokens and nft. We will also be able to send transactions and interact with the DAO.

We will also be capable of saving the wallet state, recover it and perform actions when a synchronization starts or ends.
